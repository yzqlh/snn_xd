    r"""During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with probability :attr:`p`.

    The zeroed elements are chosen independently for each forward call and are sampled from a Bernoulli distribution.

    Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call.

    This has proven to be an effective technique for regularization and
    preventing the co-adaptation of neurons as described in the paper
    `Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature
    detectors`_ .

    Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of :math:`\frac{1}{1-p}` during
    training. This means that during evaluation the module simply computes an
    identity function.

    Args:
        p: probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: 0.5
        inplace: If set to ``True``, will do this operation in-place. Default: ``False``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`. Input can be of any shape
        - Output: :math:`(*)`. Output is of the same shape as input

    A channel is a 1D feature map,

    Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call with
    probability :attr:`p` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.

    Usually the input comes from :class:`nn.Conv1d` modules.

    As described in the paper
    `Efficient Object Localization Using Convolutional Networks`_ ,
    if adjacent pixels within feature maps are strongly correlated
    (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then i.i.d. dropout
    will not regularize the activations and will otherwise just result
    in an effective learning rate decrease.

    In this case, :func:`nn.Dropout1d` will help promote independence between
    feature maps and should be used instead.

    Args:
        p (float, optional): probability of an element to be zero-ed.
        inplace (bool, optional): If set to ``True``, will do this operation

        inputs. To maintain the old behavior, switch to :class:`nn.Dropout1d`.
